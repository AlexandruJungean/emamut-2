        },
        {
          "question": "Alarm system or video surveillance system?",
          "answer": "Each system has its advantages and disadvantages. Video surveillance records events, while alarm systems warn and alert in case of unauthorized entry. The two systems complement each other."
        },
        {
          "question": "I want to start a business. Is an alarm system enough?",
          "answer": "For a business, we recommend a combination of video surveillance and alarm systems. This provides both real-time monitoring and immediate alerting in case of an incident."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need police approval for installed systems?",
          "answer": "Yes, depending on the type and size of the installed system. You will receive the installation project, user instructions, system warranty, invoice and installer code."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it important to maintain security systems?",
          "answer": "Yes. To benefit fully from system protection, it is recommended and sometimes mandatory to have them maintained and periodically checked by qualified personnel."
        },
        {
          "question": "An event was captured by our surveillance system. Am I obligated to hand over these recordings to those involved?",
          "answer": "No. System beneficiaries are obligated to provide to judicial authorities, at their written request, video recordings that capture the commission of criminal offenses."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can any type of equipment be used in security systems?",
